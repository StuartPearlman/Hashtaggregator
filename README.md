Hashtaggregator_Node
====================

Tracks, stores, streams, and displays tweets for a specified hashtag.

##App Origins
Every week, Jimmy Fallon releases a hashtag to the public and selects the funniest tweets to be featured on The Tonight Show. Currently, selecting those tweets is delegated to a staff member or even an intern.

This project sought to democratize and automate the process of streaming, ranking, and displaying those tweets. 

##Amazing Features
* Lightening fast Node back-end
* Change hashtags on the fly and watch the tweets stream in or click "Map it!" to see tweets from the default hashtag.
* Instantaneous search powered by Angular
* Interactive map courtesy of Leaflet
* Tweets turn orange on the map when they're red hot!
* Sweet gator logo provided by [Melissa Berger](http://melissaberger.com)
